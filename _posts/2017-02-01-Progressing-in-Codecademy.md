    <td>Today, I had completed 3 exercises in the first half an hour of the lesson. I thought that I had done a good amount of work. In the second half of the lesson, I only managed to complete only one exercise. I found it difficult to complete, because it was based on changing strings and using many other coding vocabulary. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was not completing as many exercises, as I hoped I would do. I think that was because I had not understood some of the new vocabulary, which caused me to not understand some aspects of the work.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>I will try to put up my hand and ask for help, after I have tried to use my knowledge and other peers.</td>
