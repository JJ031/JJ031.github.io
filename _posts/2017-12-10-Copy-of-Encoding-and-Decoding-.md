    <td>Worksheet 4 was about using the while() loop in different print statements. The task was to decide whether a program's code would function, using the while() loop. The method, which I found effective to complete this task was to work with my other classmates and eliminate the programs that did or didn’t work. I felt that I understood the function of the loop and how it is effective in a code, by discussing it with my classmates. Worksheet 5,which I started was about creating lists and using the print[] to decide which superhero was going to be chosen</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Predominantly, the habit that limited my learning was not asking the teacher for advice and guidance, I think I should’ve used my teacher more and asked more questions which could’ve developed my learning.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will need to change my idea of using the people around me, I think maybe I could’ve asked the teacher more questions that would’ve not only developed my learning but also help to understand some mistakes that I had made. It is very important to ask questions about the work you are producing as there are many ways you can change your work to make it better.</td>
