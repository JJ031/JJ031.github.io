    <td>Today, we started on a new Website called Codecademy, which is specialised to teach you into the depths of Coding. For example, Python is a high level programming language. We had to complete many different codes and be able to complete them. Whilst completing some of the codes, I worked with the person next to me, as I felt that It would help me and my partner, by learning off each other. In addition most of the tasks used functions that I was used to, such as Repeat, Print and End. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to work through some of the tasks, I will complete in the following weeks, to make sure that I get something out of completing these codes. Furthermore, I will note down how I have to improve my work and note down these into my Planner.</td>
