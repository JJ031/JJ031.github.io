    <td>We watched a video, about a small boy trying to jump over a gymnastic apparatus. He attempted this jump many times but failed every time. Every time, he failed his teacher made him go back to the starting point and attempt the jump again and again until he succeeded. Honesty was a very important part of today's lesson. Our teacher, asked us questions about failure and giving up such as Have you ever given up on something before? If we had, which I’m everyone has done in their life, we had to be honest about it and actually learn something from this lesson and take away many important tips.</td>
